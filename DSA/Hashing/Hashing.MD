The load factor, often denoted as \(\alpha\), is a measure used in hash tables to indicate how full the table is. It is defined as the ratio of the number of elements (n) to the number of slots (m) in the hash table:

\[ \alpha = \frac{n}{m} \]

where:
- \(n\) is the number of elements currently stored in the hash table.
- \(m\) is the total number of slots available in the hash table.

### Significance of Load Factor

1. **Performance**: The load factor impacts the performance of the hash table. 
   - **Low Load Factor**: If the load factor is low (close to 0), it means there are many empty slots, resulting in fewer collisions and faster average insert, delete, and search operations.
   - **High Load Factor**: If the load factor is high (close to 1), it means the table is nearly full, leading to more collisions and slower operations.

2. **Resizing**: Many hash table implementations use the load factor to decide when to resize (rehash) the table.
   - When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 0.7 or 0.75), the table is resized, typically by doubling its size and rehashing all existing elements into the new table.

### Example

Consider a hash table with 10 slots (\(m = 10\)) and 5 elements (\(n = 5\)):

\[ \alpha = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \]

The load factor is 0.5, meaning half of the slots in the hash table are occupied.

### Code Example in C

Let's look at a simple example to calculate the load factor in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

float calculateLoadFactor(int numberOfElements, int tableSize) {
    return (float) numberOfElements / tableSize;
}

int main() {
    int numberOfElements = 5;
    int tableSize = 10;
    
    float loadFactor = calculateLoadFactor(numberOfElements, tableSize);
    printf("Load Factor: %.2f\n", loadFactor);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Summary

- **Load Factor**: Ratio of the number of elements to the number of slots in a hash table.
- **Impact**: Affects the performance and dictates when to resize the hash table.
- **Example Calculation**: Simple formula \(\alpha = \frac{n}{m}\).

Maintaining an optimal load factor is crucial for efficient hash table operations. The choice of threshold for resizing depends on the specific use case and performance requirements.
